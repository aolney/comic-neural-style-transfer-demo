# Comic Neural Style Transfer Demo

Demonstration of [neural style transfer](https://github.com/xunhuang1995/AdaIN-style) particularly [suitable for comic books](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.01726.pdf). Uses [SoS notebook](https://github.com/vatlab/sos-notebook) with [itorch kernel](https://github.com/facebookarchive/iTorch).

This implementation has the advantage for demos that it is very fast and displays steps graphically.

However [the original](https://github.com/xunhuang1995/AdaIN-style) is more flexible and useful in all other respects.

This notebook should be run in the root directory of https://github.com/xunhuang1995/AdaIN-style. 
Note many paths are hardcoded for demo purposes.
